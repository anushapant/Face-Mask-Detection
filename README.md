Face Mask Detector

This project entails a Face Mask Detector, built and trained a few years ago when the pandemic was in full force. The model is a convolutional neural network based on the VGG-19 model.
The Face Mask Detection dataset from Kaggle has been used here, with rouhgly 12k images. 
A final accuracy of 98.89% was attained. 

The Model notebook is where the training actually happens, wheras the results with testing samples can be seen in the corresponding notebook.
